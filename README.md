# 🏥 Doctor Appointment Booking System - MERN Stack Project

This is a **full-stack web application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** for managing online doctor appointments. The application provides **three user roles**: **Admin**, **Doctor**, and **Patient**. Patients can book appointments with doctors, make online payments, and manage their bookings. Admins and doctors have their own dashboards to manage users, appointments, and system functionalities.
